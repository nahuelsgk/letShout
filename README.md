Has a GET param so to use cache or not. The TTL of cache is 5 minutes. By default uses Cache.

Example: http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/nahuelsgk/4

Small background
================
I decided to use Symfony as the technical test suggested the symfony as a framework, but actually I wouldn't use it. Just simply because for an API Restful I found more useful and robust Laravel.

Do not use any DB and uses local filesystem cache. As dependencies selected:
- Mockery: to unit tests and mock twitter api connection.
- j7mbo/twitter-api-php: A really simple api client.
 
The part that I spend more time to understand how to inject on the controller the dependency so I can mock it on functional tests.
